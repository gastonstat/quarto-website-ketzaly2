## About

In this report, we explore the question
__What are the chances of being a California Hispanic student attending UC Berkeley?__
:::

\

## California Hispanic students attending UC Berkeley

Take a 20-some year-old student (e.g. 20, 21, 22 years-old) born in California around 2001-2002.

According to the CDC, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr52/nvsr52_10.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr52/nvsr52_10.pdf</a>, 
there were __529,357__ live births in California in 2002. Of these, __263,061__ (almost 50%) were Hispanic live births.

To make the math easier, let's assume that there were 260,000 Hispanic babies
born in California per year during the years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004. Or put
another way, there were 1,040,000 Hispanic babies born in California during
these four years.


### UC Enrollment Data (2023)

Based on UC enrollment data (see link and figure below), in the Fall 2023 semester there were about 6847
Hispanic/Latino(a) undergraduate students enrolled in UC Berkeley.

### So, what are the odds?

Well, assuming you are a Hispanic born in California during 2001-2004 or so, your chances of attending UC Berkeley are about:

```{r odds}
6847 / 1040000
```

Or roughly 1 in 150 (1/150).

Put another way: for someone born in California somewhere between 2001-2004, their chances of being Hispanic is about 1/2, but their chances of attending UC Berkeley is only about 1/150. From 50% to 0.65% ðŸ˜².
