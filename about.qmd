title: "A little bit about me"
---

I am originally from South Corellia.

I am double majoring in Jedi Studies and Lightsabers Engineering at the Force Academy.

On my spare free time I like to read old Jedi manuscripts especially the sacred Jedi texts dating back to the dawn of the Jedi Order. I also enjoy science fiction books by Wookie authors, and I love to watch documentaries about the moon of Endor. Likewise, I like to bake & bike.

One of my favorite quotes is:

> "Do or do not. There is no try".
>
> Jedi Grand Master Yoda


My all time favorite poem is _This is the Way_ by Din Djarin.

Have I mentioned that I love PB&J?

My favorite colors are `#FF0000` and `#FFFFFF`.

I own an R3-series personal droid that my grandparents gave me on my 7th birthday.

Last but not least ...
